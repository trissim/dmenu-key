This is a fork of dmenu by the suckless team with a modification
of the xresources patch by Michal Lemke, PRatik Bhusal and Nihal 
Jere to simplify the use of pywal colors.

Change the string values of xcol in config.h to chose which
xresource entry will be used for the colors.

There is also a new key mode that can be accessed with the -k flag.
Key mode allows you to create menus with pre-determined options that can be 
accessed with a single key press. To create a key menu, pipe in the options 
with the follow format -> key1:item_to_show1\nkey2:item_to_show2\n... and so on.
