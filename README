This is a "fork" of dmenu by the suckless team with a modification
of the xresources patch by Michal Lemke, PRatik Bhusal and Nihal 
Jere to simplify the use of pywal colors.

Two patch files based off the original diff file are included.

Change the string values of xcol in config.h to chose which
xresource entry will be used for the colors.
